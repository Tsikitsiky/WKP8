### Student report :

1. In my code I have 10 functions.

 The first function is to display the songs in a list using map. 
 
 The second one is handling the form submit after adding a new song into the list.

 The third filter the title and the fourth filter the style.

 The fifth reset the filter into the normal list.

 The sixth handle the clicks whether we click the add score or the delete button.

 The seventh delete a son from the list and the eighth handle add score.

 The nineth initialise the list from local storage and the tenth update the local storage.

2. If I had more time I would improve the way I sorted the list everytime there is an update and also the filter, maybe I would have search for a way to make them in one function.

3. Did you learn anything new while working on this project?

4. The most challenging was to know where I should put the sorting, and the filter.

5. Would you like a new explanation about a specific topic?

6. Any other comments?
